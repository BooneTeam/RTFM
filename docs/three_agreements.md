# The Three Agreements: Integrity, Kindness, and Whole Self

At Dev Bootcamp, we are asking you to do a crazy thing: to learn how to be a web developer within a matter of weeks. For you to reach this goal, we need everyone to work together, follow our methodology, and agree to adhere to the rules and guidelines that have made Dev Bootcamp successful.

To outline these rules we have three agreements that guide the actions of everyone in the DBC community (staff, students, and alumni). We expect every person to uphold these values every day, throughout the entirety of the program. By enrolling in DBC, you are implicitly agreeing to uphold these agreements. If at any time you are not upholding any of these agreements, you will be asked to leave the program.

## The First Agreement: Integrity

In simplest form, this means being honest. One way to embody integrity is doing what you say you are going to do. We expect you to be in integrity by:
- Showing up on time
- Working through the curriculum each week
- Communicating with your accountability group on a weekly basis
- Reaching out to Phase 0 staff when you are struggling
- Pairing with others
- Asking for help
- Submitting and rating feedback
- Posting and responding to questions on the community
- Completing every part of the process outlined in each challenge
- Part of being in integrity also means that if you fall out of integrity, for whatever reason. you own up to it. Most of the time all it takes is an acknowledgment of being out of integrity and everybody can move on.

## The Second Agreement: Kindness

We also expect every person to be kind to one another. Kindness does not mean "nice;" they are actually not the same thing. Being kind does mean being friendly, generous, and considerate, but it does also means giving constructive, truthful feedback as long as it is Actionable, Specific, and Kind (ASK). This might also include a difficult, but necessary, conversation.

We expect everyone at DBC to show kindness by providing constant feedback to one another, holding each other accountable to unholding these three agreements, and by bringing ourselves 100% into each and every day. We also show kindness through showing respect to others and our space.

Last but not least, we expect you to be kind to yourself. You've taken a big risk and are making a big change. Give yourself some space and understanding as you face the challenges of our program.

## The Third Agreement: Whole Self

We expect you to bring your intelligence, your focus, your creativity, and your personality into each challenge every day. If you are struggling, we expect you to ask others (people in your cohort, alumni, or staff) for help. If you find that you're holding some part of you back from this experience, we ask that you focus on being authentic with your pair, your cohort, and staff. DBC flourishes when all of us feel safe being authentic with each other.

This includes exposing your ignorance and being open to uncomfortable emotional and technical challenges at DBC.

We expect everyone to complete the assigned challenges, but we want to reinforce that it's not about completing the challenge if nothing is learned. The DBC experience is fundamentally about learning. We expect you to demonstrate effort and mastery of each learning competency by completing the challenges.
