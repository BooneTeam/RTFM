# RTFM
Instructors, the following is everything you need to know for Austin.

As a culture, we err on the side of overcommunicating with students since it's easy to forget we have many assumptions in terms of what they should know. That's why throughout each phase, we're constantly reemphasizing the urgency and importance in completing and reading all challenges and additional resources.

Start by reading this. The ethos highlighted here apply as much to instructors as they do to students:

## Typical Daily Cadence

Time    | Activity                                  | Notes
---     | ---                                       | ---
8:45am  | Check in with accountability buddies      | Accountability buddies are set on Day 1. Small groups of 2-3 people. Allows individuals to bond and feel a sense of solidarity as a cohort.
9:00am  | Morning Announcements                     | Announcements from Program Coordinator, followed by open announcements, and requests for inspiring quotes.
9:05am  | Daily Progress Checkin                    | Check in from previous days challenges. We use this to check in on students progress, roadblocks, and overall wellbeing (mental and physical). Each student shares a high (e.g. learning something new, an aha moment, etc) and a low (e.g. roadblock, frustration with a challenge, etc.) from the previous day. Use this [Daily Check-in doc](https://docs.google.com/a/devbootcamp.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHSlRzkUiAnpQhoSc0FTJ9YfGazlYYX1xIzDJ_62LXI/edit?usp=sharing) as the standard per cohort.
9:25am  | Challenges/Breakouts                      | Students work in pairs, instructors support and float the room. Scheduled breakout in the morning, with ad hoc breakouts in the afternoon.
12:30pm | Lunch                                     |
2:00pm  | Afternoon Announcements                   | Announcements from Program Coordinator, followed by open announcements, and requests for jokes.
2:05pm  | Challenges/Breakouts                      | Students work solo with option to continue pairing, instructors support and float the room.
5:30pm  | Daily Progress Breakout                   | Chance for instructors to make sure students are on pace. Help outline where they should be and where they need to get to before tomorrow. Quick preview of the focus for the next day.
5:50pm  | Daily Teacher Standup                     | Daily teacher meeting where we discuss student progress and ways we can improve. 
6:00pm  | End of core hours                         | Make sure you leave at this time. It's easy to stick around and help, but you'll burn out. It's a marathon, not a sprint.
6:00pm  | After hours learning/mentoring/solo time  |

## Breakouts
Below are resources to use for breakouts for each phase. We're not hear to tell you how to teach or how to deliver the material, so feel free to create your own way. Rather, these can serve as a starting point and helps us save time collectively from recreating material. If you have any breakout materials you'd like to add or change, reach out to the lead instructor.
