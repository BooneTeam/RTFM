# Day 1 Orientation

## Intro to DBC
Dev Bootcamp's mission is to graduate world-class beginners: junior engineers that are hungry, humble, and capable of learning on their own or on the job. Most companies looking to hire junior engineers are worried about how much management time they'll have to invest in getting that junior engineer up to speed.

To that end, Dev Bootcamp we'll assess you along three critical dimensions:
- your skills as an engineer
- your skills as a student
- your skills as a teammate.

These map to three questions an employer will ask every junior engineering candidate:
- How much engineering does this applicant really know?
- How quickly and effectively can this applicant learn new material, incorporate it into their current understanding, and apply it?
- Will the team work better with the applicant as a member? Will they be a net contributor both technically and culturally?

The more clearly and confidently an employer can answer these questions, the more likely they are to hire a junior engineer. When all is said and done, the people you work with will want to know one thing: "How much 'management' time am I going to have to spend if we hire this applicant?"

It's not just about how good you are, but how confident other people are of your abilities.

## How the Challenge based system works

## Ball exercise
Objectives: Mix the group. build unity, get a read on leaders/followers.

#### How it works
- toss ball and say thank you to previous personâ€™s name and then pass to new person
- redo in same order
- redo without saying thank you and previous names
- redo, this time cutting the time in half
- redo, cut time in half again and aim to get under 6 seconds for group of 20

#### Debrief options: 
- Leader/follower roles. Request that students self identify natural tendencies to lead or follow and work to contribute to groups in other roles. 
- Embedded knowledge. Talk about how information is embedded in the group (like the sequence of throws) and how this parallels software communities. 
- Time to attempt. How long did it take to initiate an attempt? Note that innovation occurs fastest when rapid attempts take place. 

## Words of Wisdom

> if you're wondering how you should be spending your time at DBC, here's a suggestion:
>
> use the challenges we give you as a playground for identifying your weaknesses by:
>
> - reading and troubleshooting errors
> - understanding new problems
> - teaching each other
> - learning how YOU learn
>
> don't waste your time proving what you know! find out what you don't and settle into a playful curiosity.
>
> hashes, anyone? Sudoku? errors in your code? long and confusing stack traces? 
>
> don't avoid them, embrace them!
>
> lean INTO the confusion. Not away.

> Delete everything you think you know about learning from your brain and start from new. DBC teaches you to learn just as much as it teaches you to code.
>
> -- Erin

---

> be vulnerable. you're going to have extreme highs and lows, embrace this and share it. you will not make it through the next nine weeks without the people around you.
>
> -- Katherine

---

> Take care of yourself. Don't let your stress level get to high. Talk to other students and staff if you are stressed or unhappy to just get their support. Trust in the DBC system. It's only goal is for you to learn, and you will learn so much in a few weeks.

> Take care of your body. If you have a sore throat or headache AND your code is all broken, you will be absolutely miserable. So make sure that taking care of your body is a priority.

> do not think you're the only one who doesn't understand. when in doubt, ASK!  Things will be moving fast, so don't leave anything and think 'oh, I'll understand this later'.
>
> -- Zohar

---

> No need to stress out. You will not learn or know everything, nobody has and nobody will, but make sure you could learn/know about it later on, this is your main goal
