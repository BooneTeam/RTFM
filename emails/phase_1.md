# Welcome to Phase 1 - DBC Austin

Hey (cohort name),

My name is (name) and I'll be one of your teachers here in Austin. I just wanted to send over a few quick notes before we see you onsite.

## Week 1 focus - Algorithms and Coder's Mindset:

In week 1, we'll be focusing on the basics of Ruby; there is overlap with some of the Phase 0 curriculum. The week begins with writing simple methods in a [procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming) style. You'll be exposed to and encouraged to write pseudocode as part of your planning. In terms of code quality, we encourage you to write code that is human readable and maintainable (e.g., well named variables and methods, proper indentation, DRY, etc.). As the week progresses, you'll begin to encounter challenges requiring more complex problem solving and are expected to be able to write both iterative and recursive solutions. But we'll get to that in due time :)


## To do before you arrive:
- Authorize your GitHub with our system. Go to: https://launchpad.devbootcamp.com/#me and authorize your Github account.  (This is separate from phase 0 Github authorization.  Some people already have, but please visit this and confirm either way).
- Update your Github profile with a current picture of you OR upload a picture into our private system by editing your profile on https://launchpad.devbootcamp.com.  Our internal systems use this picture and help us learn your faces!

We're super excited for your first day onsite and I look forward to meeting you all!

See you on Monday morning!
